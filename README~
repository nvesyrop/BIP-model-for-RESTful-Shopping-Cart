Program Details
----------------------------------
This is the BIP source code and executable model for a REST 
client-server Web Service architecture for a Shopping Cart.

Description of service operations
----------------------------------
The Web Service provides the following operations:
a) GET availItems, for getting the available items.
 	- The request contains a list of available items.
	
b) PUT cartsItems/[cartId]/[itemId], for adding an item to a shopping cart
	- The request contains a cartId and an itemId
	- If the item exists, it is removed from the available items and added to the cart.
	- If the item doesn't exist, the response contains an error code for the exception.

Instructions for compiling and running
----------------------------------
We provide 1)an executable file and 2)the source
code to build the program from scratch.
The instructions that follow serve the two cases:

A. How to Build the BIP model from source

Prerequisites:
- OS: LINUX (tested on an Ubuntu 12.04 x64 machine)
- The new versions of the BIP compiler + engine (in http://www-verimag.imag.fr/New-BIP-tools.html)

1. First you unzip the folder to some location <ROOT_LOC>

	$ unzip BIPrest.zip -d <ROOT_LOC>

2. Then you run the build.sh 

	$ cd <ROOT_LOC>
	$ ./build.sh 

3. And you run the executable, using the instructions in B


B. How to Run the executable BIP model 

The Web Service executable can be run from the command line using interactive execution
, where at each point the available interactions are shown to the user in order for him 
to choose which one will be realized:

	$ ./build/system -i
