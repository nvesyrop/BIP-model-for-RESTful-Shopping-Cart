# BIP-model-for-RESTful-Shopping-Cart-

A BIP model developed for the needs of an academic publication titled "Correct by Construction Web Service Architecture" (link: http://depend.csd.auth.gr/publications.php), in collaboration with the DSG group of the Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

It pertains to a RESTful client-server Web Service architecture for a Shopping Cart.

In order to compile an executable for the BIP model from BIP source code, you must fullfil the following prerequisites: 

1)OS: LINUX (tested on an Ubuntu 12.04 x64 machine)

2)The new versions of the BIP compiler + engine (link: http://www-verimag.imag.fr/New-BIP-tools.html) 

Then you have to follow the following steps: 

1. Place the source files to some location <root_loc> 
2. Run the build.sh ($ cd <root_loc> and then $ ./build.sh) 
3. Run the generated executable ($ ./build/system -i)
